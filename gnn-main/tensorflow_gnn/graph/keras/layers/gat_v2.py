# DEVELOPER NOTES ABOUT ATTENTION
#
# Recall that attention is a deep learning technique to aggregate input data
# from multiple senders to one or more receivers, with emphasis on the inputs
# deemed most relevant for each receiver. Mathematically, the aggregation is a
# weighted average of values derived from the input data. The weights are
# computed by a dedicated feed-forwad network that is conditioned on both the
# values and the query, which is derived from the state of the receiver.
#
# TF-GNN can apply attention across all of the many-to-one relationships
# in a GraphTensor. TF-GNN breaks down the various cases as follows.
#
#  1. Convolutions from nodes.
#
#     a) The classic case: convolutions over an edge set. The receiver node
#        (whose node state stands to be updated from the result) poses a query.
#        Values are aggregated from its incident edges, after being computed
#        on each edge involving a feature of the sender node at the other end
#        of the edge, and optionally also involving a feature of the edge
#        itself.
#     b) Convolutions from a node set to context: Sender nodes are as in
#        case (1a). Instead of an EdgeSet, there is the containment of nodes
#        in graph components, which is tracked by the NodeSet itself without
#        storing edges explicitly. Instead of receiver nodes, there is the
#        per-component context, which poses a query and receives the result.
#
#  2. Pooling from edges.
#
#     a) Pooling edge states to an incident node: This works like a convolution
#        in case (1a) with the side input for the edge feature switched on and
#        the main input from the sender node switched off.
#     b) Pooling edge states to context: Like in case (1b), the receiver is
#        the context, and senders are connected to it by containment in a graph
#        component. Unlike case (1b), but similar to case (2a), input from nodes
#        is switched off and input from edges is switched on.
#
# For case (1), TF-GNN offer attention through Convolution layers, with sender
# node inputs on by default and sender edge inputs off by default. The sub-cases
# are distinguised by receiver_tag SOURCE or TARGET for (a) and CONTEXT for (b).
# The side input from edges can be activated in case (1a) only.
#
# For case (2), TF-GNN offers attention throuh EdgePool wrappers, with the
# opposite settings for sender inputs: nodes off, edges on. The sub-cases
# are distinguished in the same way by the receiver_tag.
#
# KEY POINT 1: This lets library contributors implement a wide variety of
# attention algorithms just once, in the familiar shape of a convolution
# (generalized to support context as target and to take a side input from
# edges). From that, edge pooling can be derived with a simple wrapper
# (maybe later, if the original contributor does not care about edge states).
#
# KEY POINT 2: Library users whose models do not have edge states just need
# to understand the notion of a Convolution layer. Library users whose models
# also have edge states need to understand the notion of an EdgePool layer
# as well, but the dividing line between the two is crystal-clear:
# Does it read node features or not?
#
# Side remark: These two advantages prompted the design choice to regard
# case (1b) as a convolution analogous to case (1a) and not a pooling operation
# analogous to case (2b), although the latter is more similar in terms of the
# operations it does (pooling with attention but no initial broadcast).

class GATv2Convolution(tf.keras.layers.Layer):
  """The multi-head attention from Graph Attention Networks v2 (GATv2).

  GATv2 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491) improves upon the popular
  GAT architecture (https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) by allowing the network
  to compute a more expressive "dynamic" instead of just "static" attention,
  each of whose heads is described by Equations (7), (3) and (4) in
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14491.

  Example: GATv2-style attention on incoming edges whose result is
  concatenated with the old node state and passed through a Dense layer
  to compute the new node state.
  ```
  dense = tf.keras.layers.Dense
  graph = tfgnn.keras.layers.GraphUpdate(
      node_sets={"paper": tfgnn.keras.layers.NodeSetUpdate(
          {"cites": tfgnn.keras.layers.GATv2Convolution(
               message_dim, receiver_tag=tfgnn.TARGET)},
          tfgnn.keras.layers.NextStateFromConcat(dense(node_state_dim)))}
  )(graph)
  ```

  This layer implements the multi-head attention of GATv2 with the following
  generalizations:
    * This implementation of GATv2 attends only to edges that are explicitly
      stored in the input GraphTensor. Attention of a node to itself is
      enabled or disabled by storing or not storing an explicit loop in the
      edge set. The example above uses a separate layer to combine the old
      node state with the attention result to form the new node state.
      TODO(b/205960151): Do we have a good example for not storing the loop?
    * Attention values can be computed from a sender node state that gets
      broadcast onto the edge (see arg `sender_node_feature`), from an edge
      feature (see arg `sender_edge_feature`), or rom their concatenation
      (by setting both arguments). This choice is used in place of the sender
      node state $h_j$ in the defining equations cited above.
    * This layer can be used with `receiver_tag=tfgnn.CONTEXT` to perform a
      convolution to the context, with graph components as receivers and the
      containment in graph components used in lieu of edges.
    * An `edge_dropout` option is provided.

  This layer can also be configured to do attention pooling from edges to
  context or to receiver nodes (without regard for source nodes) by setting
  `sender_node_feature=None` and setting `sender_edge_feature=...` to the
  applicable edge feature name (e.g., `tfgnn.DEFAULT_FEATURE_NAME`).

  Like the Keras Dense layer, if the input features have rank greater than 2,
  this layer computes a point-wise attention along the last axis of the inputs.
  For example, if the input features have shape [num_nodes, 2, 4, 1], then it
  will perform an identical computation on each of the num_nodes * 2 * 4 input
  values.

  Init args:
    num_heads: The number of attention heads.
    per_head_channels: The number of channels for each attention head. This
      means that the final output size will be per_head_channels * num_heads.
    receiver_tag: The results of attention are aggregated for this graph piece.
      If set to `tfgnn.CONTEXT`, the layer can be called for an edge set or
      node set.
      If set to an IncidentNodeTag (e.g., `tfgnn.SOURCE` or `tfgnn.TARGET`),
      the layer can be called for an edge set and will aggregate results at
      the specified endpoint of the edges.
      If left unset for init, the tag must be passed at call time.
    receiver_feature: Can be set to override `tfgnn.DEFAULT_FEATURE_NAME`
      for use as the receiver's input feature to attention. (The attention key
      is derived from this input.)
    sender_node_feature: Can be set to override `tfgnn.DEFAULT_FEATURE_NAME`
      for use as the input feature from sender nodes to attention.
      IMPORANT: Must be set to `None` for use with `receiver_tag=tfgnn.CONTEXT`
      on an edge set, or for pooling from edges without sender node states.
    sender_edge_feature: Can be set to a feature name of the edge set to select
      it as an input feature. By default, this input is switched off.
      IMPORTANT: Must be set for use with `receiver_tag=tfgnn.CONTEXT`
      on an edge set.
    use_bias: If true, a bias term is added to the transformations of query and
      value inputs.
    edge_dropout: Can be set to a dropout rate for edge dropout. (When pooling
      nodes to context, it's the node's membership in a graph component that
      is dropped out.)
    attention_activation: The nonlinearity used on the transformed inputs
      before multiplying with the trained weights of the attention layer.
      This can be specified as a Keras layer, a tf.keras.activations.*
      function, or a string understood by tf.keras.layers.Activation().
      Defaults to "leaky_relu", which in turn defaults to a negative slope
      of alpha=0.2.
    activation: The nonlinearity applied to the final result of attention,
      specified in the same ways as attention_activation.
    kernel_initializer: Can be set to a `kerner_initializer` as understood
      by tf.keras.layers.Dense etc.

  """Returns a layer for pooling with GATv2-style attention.

  When initialized with receiver_tag SOURCE or TARGET, the returned layer can
  be called on an edge set to compute the weighted sum of edge states at the
  given endpoint. The weights are computed by the method of Graph Attention
  Networks v2 (GATv2), except that edge states, not node states broadcast from
  the edges' other endpoint, are used as input values to attention.

  When initialized with receiver_tag CONTEXT, the returned layer can be called
  on an edge set to do the analogous pooling of edge states to context.

  NOTE: This layer cannot pool node states. For that, use GATv2Convolution.

  Args:
    num_heads: The number of attention heads.
    per_head_channels: The number of channels for each attention head. This
      means that the final output size will be per_head_channels * num_heads.
    receiver_tag: The results of attention are aggregated for this graph piece.
      If set to `tfgnn.CONTEXT`, the layer can be called for an edge set or
      node set.
      If set to an IncidentNodeTag (e.g., `tfgnn.SOURCE` or `tfgnn.TARGET`),
      the layer can be called for an edge set and will aggregate results at
      the specified endpoint of the edges.
      If left unset, the tag must be passed when calling the layer.
    receiver_feature: By default, the default state feature of the receiver
      is used to compute the attention query. A different feature name can be
      selected by setting this argument.
    sender_feature: By default, the default state feature of the node set
      or edge set passed to call() is used to compute the attention values.

  The returned layer performs one update step of a Graph Attention Network v2

  It is best suited for graphs that have just that one edge set.
  For heterogeneous graphs with multiple node sets and edge sets, users are
  advised to consider a GraphUpdate with one or more GATv2Convolution objects
  instead.

  This implementation of GAT attends only to edges that are explicitly stored

  explicit loop in the edge set.
