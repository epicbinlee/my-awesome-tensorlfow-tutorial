  Init args:
    edge_set_update: An EdgeSetUpdate layer (or custom reimplementation) that
      computes new edge states from the input graph tensor. Its results are
      pooled for the receiver node set and returned from this layer.

      receiver node. Defaults to "sum", can be set to any name from
      tfgnn.get_registered_reduce_operation_names().

  Call returns:
    A tensor or dict of tensors with the result of edge_set_update, pooled for
