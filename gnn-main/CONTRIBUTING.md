# How to Contribute

We'd love to have your contributions to this project! There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Scope &amp; Focus

For this initial release, and likely for the next several releases, we will be
driven by internal, production needs and will therefore need to prioritize our
internal users requirements. However, we want to encourage that you submit
contributions, either as issues or PRs within this proejct or as an RFC in
the [TensorFlow Community RFC](https://github.com/tensorflow/community/tree/master/rfcs)
repo.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution;
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Code Reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
