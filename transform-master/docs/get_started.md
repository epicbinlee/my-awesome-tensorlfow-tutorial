# Get Started with TensorFlow Transform

This guide introduces the basic concepts of `tf.Transform` and how to use them.
It will:

*   Define a *preprocessing function*, a logical description of the pipeline
    that transforms the raw data into the data used to train a machine learning
    model.
*   Show the [Apache Beam](https://beam.apache.org/) implementation used to
    transform data by converting the *preprocessing function* into a *Beam
    pipeline*.
*   Show additional usage examples.

## Define a preprocessing function

The *preprocessing function* is the most important concept of `tf.Transform`.
The preprocessing function is a logical description of a transformation of the
dataset. The preprocessing function accepts and returns a dictionary of tensors,
where a *tensor* means `Tensor` or `SparseTensor`. There are two kinds of
functions used to define the preprocessing function:

1. Any function that accepts and returns tensors. These add TensorFlow
   operations to the graph that transform raw data into transformed data.
2. Any of the *analyzers* provided by `tf.Transform`. Analyzers also accept
   and return tensors, but unlike TensorFlow functions, they *do not* add
   operations to the graph. Instead, analyzers cause `tf.Transform` to compute
   a full-pass operation outside of TensorFlow. They use the input tensor values
   over the entire dataset to generate a constant tensor that is returned as the
   output. For example, `tft.min` computes the minimum of a tensor over the
   dataset. `tf.Transform` provides a fixed set of analyzers, but this will be
   extended in future versions.

### Preprocessing function example

By combining analyzers and regular TensorFlow functions, users can create
flexible pipelines for transforming data. The following preprocessing function
transforms each of the three features in different ways, and combines two of the
features:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_transform as tft
import tensorflow_transform.beam as tft_beam

def preprocessing_fn(inputs):
  x = inputs['x']
  y = inputs['y']
  s = inputs['s']
  x_centered = x - tft.mean(x)
  y_normalized = tft.scale_to_0_1(y)
  s_integerized = tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary(s)
  x_centered_times_y_normalized = x_centered * y_normalized
  return {
      'x_centered': x_centered,
      'y_normalized': y_normalized,
      'x_centered_times_y_normalized': x_centered_times_y_normalized,
      's_integerized': s_integerized
  }
```

Here, `x`, `y` and `s` are `Tensor`s that represent input features. The first
new tensor that is created, `x_centered`, is built by applying `tft.mean` to `x`
and subtracting this from `x`. `tft.mean(x)` returns a tensor representing the
mean of the tensor `x`. `x_centered` is the tensor `x` with the mean subtracted.

The second new tensor, `y_normalized`, is created in a similar manner but using
the convenience method `tft.scale_to_0_1`. This method does something similar to
computing `x_centered`, namely computing a maximum and minimum and using these
to scale `y`.

The tensor `s_integerized` shows an example of string manipulation. In this
case, we take a string and map it to an integer. This uses the convenience
function `tft.compute_and_apply_vocabulary`. This function uses an analyzer to
compute the unique values taken by the input strings, and then uses TensorFlow
operations to convert the input strings to indices in the table of unique
values.

The final column shows that it is possible to use TensorFlow operations to
create new features by combining tensors.

The preprocessing function defines a pipeline of operations on a dataset. In
order to apply the pipeline, we rely on a concrete implementation of the
`tf.Transform` API. The Apache Beam implementation provides `PTransform` which
applies a user's preprocessing function to data. The typical workflow of a
`tf.Transform` user will construct a preprocessing function, then incorporate
this into a larger Beam pipeline, creating the data for training.

### Batching

Batching is an important part of TensorFlow. Since one of the goals of
`tf.Transform` is to provide a TensorFlow graph for preprocessing that can be
incorporated into the serving graph (and, optionally, the training graph),
batching is also an important concept in `tf.Transform`.

While not obvious in the example above, the user defined preprocessing function
is passed tensors representing *batches* and not individual instances, as
happens during training and serving with TensorFlow. On the other hand,
analyzers perform a computation over the entire dataset that returns a single
value and not a batch of values. `x` is a `Tensor` with a shape of
`(batch_size,)`, while `tft.mean(x)` is a `Tensor` with a shape of `()`. The
subtraction `x - tft.mean(x)` broadcasts where the value of `tft.mean(x)` is
subtracted from every element of the batch represented by `x`.

## Apache Beam Implementation

While the *preprocessing function* is intended as a logical description of a
*preprocessing pipeline* implemented on multiple data processing frameworks,
`tf.Transform` provides a canonical implementation used on Apache Beam. This
implementation demonstrates the functionality required from an implementation.
There is no formal API for this functionality, so each implementation can use an
API that is idiomatic for its particular data processing framework.

The Apache Beam implementation provides two `PTransform`s used to process data
for a preprocessing function. The following shows the usage for the composite
`PTransform AnalyzeAndTransformDataset`:

```python
raw_data = [
    {'x': 1, 'y': 1, 's': 'hello'},
    {'x': 2, 'y': 2, 's': 'world'},
    {'x': 3, 'y': 3, 's': 'hello'}
]

raw_data_metadata = ...
transformed_dataset, transform_fn = (
    (raw_data, raw_data_metadata) | tft_beam.AnalyzeAndTransformDataset(
        preprocessing_fn))
transformed_data, transformed_metadata = transformed_dataset
```

The `transformed_data` content is shown below and contains the transformed
columns in the same format as the raw data. In particular, the values of
`s_integerized` are `[0, 1, 0]`—these values depend on how the words `hello` and
`world` were mapped to integers, which is deterministic. For the column
`x_centered`, we subtracted the mean so the values of the column `x`, which were
`[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`, became `[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]`. Similarly, the rest of the columns
match their expected values.

```python
[{u's_integerized': 0,
  u'x_centered': -1.0,
  u'x_centered_times_y_normalized': -0.0,
  u'y_normalized': 0.0},
 {u's_integerized': 1,
  u'x_centered': 0.0,
  u'x_centered_times_y_normalized': 0.0,
  u'y_normalized': 0.5},
 {u's_integerized': 0,
  u'x_centered': 1.0,
  u'x_centered_times_y_normalized': 1.0,
  u'y_normalized': 1.0}]
```

Both `raw_data` and `transformed_data` are datasets. The next two sections show
how the Beam implementation represents datasets and how to read and write data
to disk. The other return value, `transform_fn`, represents the transformation
applied to the data, covered in detail below.

The `AnalyzeAndTransformDataset` is the composition of the two fundamental
transforms provided by the implementation `AnalyzeDataset` and
`TransformDataset`. So the following two code snippets are equivalent:

```python
transformed_data, transform_fn = (
    my_data | tft_beam.AnalyzeAndTransformDataset(preprocessing_fn))
```

```python
transform_fn = my_data | tft_beam.AnalyzeDataset(preprocessing_fn)
transformed_data = (my_data, transform_fn) | tft_beam.TransformDataset()
```

`transform_fn` is a pure function that represents an operation that is applied
to each row of the dataset. In particular, the analyzer values are already
computed and treated as constants. In the example, the `transform_fn` contains
as constants the mean of column `x`, the min and max of column `y`, and the
vocabulary used to map the strings to integers.

An important feature of `tf.Transform` is that `transform_fn` represents a map
*over rows*—it is a pure function applied to each row separately. All of the
computation for aggregating rows is done in `AnalyzeDataset`. Furthermore, the
`transform_fn` is represented as a TensorFlow `Graph` which can be embedded into
the serving graph.

`AnalyzeAndTransformDataset` is provided for optimizations in this special case.
This is the same pattern used in
[scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html), providing the `fit`,
`transform`, and `fit_transform` methods.

## Data Formats and Schema

TFT Beam implementation accepts two different input data formats. The
"instance dict" format (as seen in the example above and in `simple_example.py`)
is an intuitive format and is suitable for small datasets while the TFXIO
([Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org)) format provides improved performance
and is suitble for large datasets.

The Beam implementation tells which format the input PCollection would be in
by the "metadata" accompanying the PCollection:

```python
(raw_data, raw_data_metadata) | tft.AnalyzeDataset(...)
```

- If `raw_data_metadata` is a `dataset_metadata.DatasetMetadata` (see below,
  "The 'instance dict' format" section),
  then `raw_data` is expected to be in the "instance dict" format.
- If `raw_data_metadata` is a `tfxio.TensorAdapterConfig`
  (see below, "The TFXIO format" section), then `raw_data` is expected to be
  in the TFXIO format.

### The "instance dict" format

In the previous code examples, the code defining `raw_data_metadata` is omitted.
The metadata contains the schema that defines the layout of the data so it is
read from and written to various formats. Even the in-memory format shown in the
last section is not self-describing and requires the schema in order to be
interpreted as tensors.

Here's the definition of the schema for the example data:

```python
from tensorflow_transform.tf_metadata import dataset_metadata
from tensorflow_transform.tf_metadata import schema_utils

raw_data_metadata = dataset_metadata.DatasetMetadata(
      schema_utils.schema_from_feature_spec({
        's': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.string),
        'y': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32),
        'x': tf.io.FixedLenFeature([], tf.float32),
    }))
```

The `Schema` proto contains the information needed to parse the
data from its on-disk or in-memory format, into tensors. It is typically
constructed by calling `schema_utils.schema_from_feature_spec` with a dict
mapping feature keys to `tf.io.FixedLenFeature`, `tf.io.VarLenFeature`, and
`tf.io.SparseFeature` values. See the documentation for
[`tf.parse_example`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/parse_example)
for more details.

Above we use `tf.io.FixedLenFeature` to indicate that each feature contains a
fixed number of values, in this case a single scalar value. Because
`tf.Transform` batches instances, the actual `Tensor` representing the feature
will have shape `(None,)` where the unknown dimension is the batch dimension.

### The TFXIO format

With this format, the data is expected to be contained in a
[`pyarrow.RecordBatch`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.RecordBatch.html).
For tabular data, our Apache Beam implementation
accepts Arrow `RecordBatch`es that consist of columns of the following types:

  - `pa.list_(<primitive>)`, where `<primitive>` is `pa.int64()`, `pa.float32()`
    `pa.binary()` or `pa.large_binary()`.

  - `pa.large_list(<primitive>)`

The toy input dataset we used above, when represented as a `RecordBatch`, looks
like the following:

```python
raw_data = [
    pa.record_batch([
        pa.array([[1], [2], [3]], pa.list_(pa.float32())),
        pa.array([[1], [2], [3]], pa.list_(pa.float32())),
        pa.array([['hello'], ['world'], ['hello']], pa.list_(pa.binary())),
    ], ['x', 'y', 's'])
]
```

Similar to DatasetMetadata being needed to accompany the "instance dict" format,
a [`tfxio.TensorAdapterConfig`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tfx_bsl/api_docs/python/tfx_bsl/public/tfxio/TensorAdapterConfig)
is needed to accompany the `RecordBatch`es. It consists of the Arrow schema of
the `RecordBatch`es, and
[`TensorRepresentations`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tfx_bsl/api_docs/python/tfx_bsl/public/tfxio/TensorRepresentations)
to uniquely determine how columns in `RecordBatch`es can be interpreted as
TensorFlow Tensors (including but not limited to tf.Tensor, tf.SparseTensor).

`TensorRepresentations` is a `Dict[Text, TensorRepresentation]` which
establishes the relationship between a Tensor that `preprocessing_fn` accepts
and columns in the `RecordBatch`es. For example:

```python
tensor_representation = {
    'x': text_format.Parse(
        """dense_tensor { column_name: "col1" shape { dim { size: 2 } } }"""
        schema_pb2.TensorRepresentation())
}
```

Means that `inputs['x']` in `preprocessing_fn` should be a dense tf.Tensor,
whose values come from a column of name `'col1'` in the input `RecordBatch`es,
and its (batched) shape should be `[batch_size, 2]`.

`TensorRepresentation` is a Protobuf defined in
[TensorFlow Metadata](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/v0.22.2/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto#L592).

## Compatibility with TensorFlow

`tf.Transform` provides support for exporting the `transform_fn` above either as
a TF 1.x or a TF 2.x SavedModel. The default behavior before the `0.30` release
exported a TF 1.x SavedModel. Starting with the `0.30` release, the default
behavior is to export a TF 2.x SavedModel unless TF 2.x behaviors are explicitly
disabled (by calling `tf.compat.v1.disable_v2_behavior()` for example).

If using TF 1.x concepts such as `Estimators` and `Sessions`, you can retain the
previous behavior by passing `force_tf_compat_v1=True` to
[`tft_beam.Context`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/api_docs/python/tft_beam/Context)
if using `tf.Transform` as a standalone library or to the
[Transform](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/api_docs/python/tfx/components/Transform)
component in TFX.

When exporting the `transform_fn` as a TF 2.x SavedModel, the `preprocessing_fn`
is expected to be traceable using `tf.function`. Additionally, if running your
pipeline remotely (for example with the `DataflowRunner`), ensure that the
`preprocessing_fn` and any dependencies are packaged properly as described
[here](https://beam.apache.org/documentation/sdks/python-pipeline-dependencies/#multiple-file-dependencies).

Known issues with using `tf.Transform` to export a TF 2.x SavedModel are
documented [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/transform/tf2_support).

## Input and output with Apache Beam

So far, we've seen input and output data in python lists (of `RecordBatch`es or
instance dictionaries). This is a simplification that relies on Apache Beam's
ability to work with lists as well as its main representation of data, the
`PCollection`.

A `PCollection` is a data representation that forms a part of a Beam pipeline.
A Beam pipeline is formed by applying various `PTransform`s, including
`AnalyzeDataset` and `TransformDataset`, and running the pipeline. A
`PCollection` is not created in the memory of the main binary, but instead is
distributed among the workers (although this section uses the in-memory
execution mode).

### Pre-canned `PCollection` Sources (`TFXIO`)

The `RecordBatch` format that our implementation accepts is a common format that
other TFX libraries accept. Therefore TFX offers convenient "sources" (a.k.a
`TFXIO`) that read files of various formats on disk and produce `RecordBatch`es
and can also give `TensorAdapterConfig`, including inferred
`TensorRepresentations`.

Those `TFXIO`s can be found in package `tfx_bsl` ([`tfx_bsl.public.tfxio`](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tfx_bsl/api_docs/python/tfx_bsl/public/tfxio)).

### Example: "Census Income" dataset

The following example requires both reading and writing data on disk and
representing data as a `PCollection` (not a list), see:
[`census_example.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform/tree/master/examples/census_example.py).
Below we show how to download the data and run this example. The "Census Income"
dataset is provided by the
[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income).
This dataset contains both categorical and numeric data.

The data is in CSV format, here are the first two lines:

```
39, State-gov, 77516, Bachelors, 13, Never-married, Adm-clerical, Not-in-family, White, Male, 2174, 0, 40, United-States, <=50K
50, Self-emp-not-inc, 83311, Bachelors, 13, Married-civ-spouse, Exec-managerial, Husband, White, Male, 0, 0, 13, United-States, <=50K
```

The columns of the dataset are either categorical or numeric. This dataset
describes a classification problem: predicting the last column where the
individual earns more or less than 50K per year. However, from the perspective
of `tf.Transform`, this label is just another categorical column.

We use a Pre-canned `TFXIO`, `BeamRecordCsvTFXIO` to translate the CSV lines
into `RecordBatches`. `TFXIO` requires two important piece of information:

  - a [TensorFlow Metadata Schema](https://github.com/tensorflow/metadata/blob/master/tensorflow_metadata/proto/v0/schema.proto)
    that contains type and shape information about each CSV column.
    `TensorRepresentation`s are an optional part of the Schema; if not provided
    (which is the case in this example), they will be inferred from the type and
    shape information. One can get the Schema either by using a helper function
    we provide to translate from TF parsing specs (shown in this example), or by
    running
    [TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/tutorials/data_validation/tfdv_basic).

  - a list of column names, in the order they appear in the CSV file. Note
    that those names must match the feature names in the Schema.

In this example we allow the `education-num` feature to be missing. This means
that it is represented as a `tf.io.VarLenFeature` in the feature_spec, and as a
`tf.SparseTensor` in the `preprocessing_fn`. Other features will become
`tf.Tensor`s of the same name in the `preprocessing_fn`.

```python
csv_tfxio = tfxio.BeamRecordCsvTFXIO(
    physical_format='text', column_names=ordered_columns, schema=SCHEMA)

record_batches = (
    p
    | 'ReadTrainData' >> textio.ReadFromText(train_data_file)
    | ...  # fix up csv lines
    | 'ToRecordBatches' >> csv_tfxio.BeamSource())

tensor_adapter_config = csv_tfxio.TensorAdapterConfig()
```

Note that we had to do some additional fix-ups after the CSV lines are read
in. Otherwise, we could rely on the `CsvTFXIO` to handle both reading the files
and translating to `RecordBatch`es:

```python
csv_tfxio = tfxio.CsvTFXIO(train_data_file, column_name=ordered_columns,
                           schema=SCHEMA)
record_batches = p | 'TFXIORead' >> csv_tfxio.BeamSource()
tensor_adapter_config = csv_tfxio.TensorAdapterConfig()
```

Preprocessing is similar to the previous example, except the preprocessing
function is programmatically generated instead of manually specifying each
column. In the preprocessing function below, `NUMERICAL_COLUMNS` and
`CATEGORICAL_COLUMNS` are lists that contain the names of the numeric and
categorical columns:

```python
def preprocessing_fn(inputs):
  """Preprocess input columns into transformed columns."""
  # Since we are modifying some features and leaving others unchanged, we
  # start by setting `outputs` to a copy of `inputs.
  outputs = inputs.copy()

  # Scale numeric columns to have range [0, 1].
  for key in NUMERIC_FEATURE_KEYS:
    outputs[key] = tft.scale_to_0_1(outputs[key])

  for key in OPTIONAL_NUMERIC_FEATURE_KEYS:
    # This is a SparseTensor because it is optional. Here we fill in a default
    # value when it is missing.
      sparse = tf.sparse.SparseTensor(outputs[key].indices, outputs[key].values,
                                      [outputs[key].dense_shape[0], 1])
      dense = tf.sparse.to_dense(sp_input=sparse, default_value=0.)
    # Reshaping from a batch of vectors of size 1 to a batch to scalars.
    dense = tf.squeeze(dense, axis=1)
    outputs[key] = tft.scale_to_0_1(dense)

  # For all categorical columns except the label column, we generate a
  # vocabulary but do not modify the feature.  This vocabulary is instead
  # used in the trainer, by means of a feature column, to convert the feature
  # from a string to an integer id.
  for key in CATEGORICAL_FEATURE_KEYS:
    tft.vocabulary(inputs[key], vocab_filename=key)

  # For the label column we provide the mapping from string to index.
  initializer = tf.lookup.KeyValueTensorInitializer(
      keys=['>50K', '<=50K'],
      values=tf.cast(tf.range(2), tf.int64),
      key_dtype=tf.string,
      value_dtype=tf.int64)
  table = tf.lookup.StaticHashTable(initializer, default_value=-1)

  outputs[LABEL_KEY] = table.lookup(outputs[LABEL_KEY])

  return outputs
```

One difference from the previous example is the label column manually specifies
the mapping from the string to an index. So `'>50'` is mapped to `0` and
`'<=50K'` is mapped to `1` because it's useful to know which index in the
trained model corresponds to which label.

The `record_batches` variable represents a `PCollection` of
`pyarrow.RecordBatch`es. The `tensor_adapter_config` is given by `csv_tfxio`,
which is inferred from `SCHEMA` (and ultimately, in this example, from the TF
parsing specs).

The final stage is to write the transformed data to disk and has a similar form
to reading the raw data. The schema used to do this is part of the output of
`AnalyzeAndTransformDataset` which infers a schema for the output data. The code
to write to disk is shown below. The schema is a part of the metadata but uses
the two interchangeably in the `tf.Transform` API (i.e. pass the metadata to the
`ExampleProtoCoder`). Be aware that this writes to a different format. Instead
of `textio.WriteToText`, use Beam's built-in support for the `TFRecord` format
and use a coder to encode the data as `Example` protos. This is a better format
to use for training, as shown in the next section. `transformed_eval_data_base`
provides the base filename for the individual shards that are written.

```python
transformed_data | "WriteTrainData" >> tfrecordio.WriteToTFRecord(
    transformed_eval_data_base,
    coder=tft.coders.ExampleProtoCoder(transformed_metadata))
```

In addition to the training data, `transform_fn` is also written out with the
metadata:

```python
_ = (
    transform_fn
    | 'WriteTransformFn' >> tft_beam.WriteTransformFn(working_dir))
transformed_metadata | 'WriteMetadata' >> tft_beam.WriteMetadata(
    transformed_metadata_file, pipeline=p)
```

Run the entire Beam pipeline with `p.run().wait_until_finish()`. Up until this
point, the Beam pipeline represents a deferred, distributed computation. It
provides instructions for what will be done, but the instructions have not been
executed. This final call executes the specified pipeline.

### Download the census dataset

Download the census dataset using the following shell commands:

<pre class="prettyprint lang-bsh">
  <code class="devsite-terminal">wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.data</code>
  <code class="devsite-terminal">wget https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/adult.test</code>
</pre>

When running the
[`census_example.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform/tree/master/examples/census_example.py)
script, pass the directory containing this data as the first argument. The
script creates a temporary sub-directory to add the preprocessed data.

## Integrate with TensorFlow Training

The final section of
[`census_example.py`](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform/tree/master/examples/census_example.py)
show how the preprocessed data is used to train a model. See the
[Estimators documentation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/estimators/linear)
for details. The first step is to construct an `Estimator` which requires a
description of the preprocessed columns. Each numeric column is described as a
`real_valued_column` that is a wrapper around a dense vector with a fixed size
(`1` in this example). Each categorical column is mapped from string to integers
and then gets passed into `indicator_column`. `tft.TFTransformOutput` is used to
find the vocabulary file path for each categorical feature.

```python
real_valued_columns = [feature_column.real_valued_column(key)
                       for key in NUMERIC_FEATURE_KEYS]

one_hot_columns = [
    tf.feature_column.indicator_column(
        tf.feature_column.categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file(
            key=key,
            vocabulary_file=tf_transform_output.vocabulary_file_by_name(
                vocab_filename=key)))
    for key in CATEGORICAL_FEATURE_KEYS]

estimator = tf.estimator.LinearClassifier(real_valued_columns + one_hot_columns)
```

The next step is to create a builder to generate the input function for training
and evaluation. The differs from the training used by `tf.Learn` since a feature
spec is not required to parse the transformed data. Instead, use the metadata
for the transformed data to generate a feature spec.

```python
def _make_training_input_fn(tf_transform_output, transformed_examples,
                            batch_size):
  ...
  def input_fn():
    """Input function for training and eval."""
    dataset = tf.data.experimental.make_batched_features_dataset(
        ..., tf_transform_output.transformed_feature_spec(), ...)

    transformed_features = tf.compat.v1.data.make_one_shot_iterator(
        dataset).get_next()
    ...

  return input_fn
```

The remaining code is the same as using the
[`Estimator`](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/Estimator)
class. The example also contains code to export the model in the `SavedModel`
format. The exported model can be used by
[Tensorflow Serving](https://www.tensorflow.org/serving/serving_basic) or the
[Cloud ML Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine/docs/prediction-overview).
